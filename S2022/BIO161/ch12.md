# Chapter 12 Review
### 1. Describe the major phases of the cell cycle
1. **Interphase:** cell in non-dividing state
      1. **G<sub>1</sub>:** *growth phase* -- cell synthezises mRNA and proteins in preparation for mitosis
      2. **S:** DNA is replicated
      3. **G<sub>2</sub>:** extra proteins synthesized, organelles multiply so that there are enough for 2 cells.
   2. **Mitotic phase:** cell in dividing state
   
### 2. What happens during each of the 4 phases of the mitotic cycle?

   1. **Mitosis:** DNA condenses into chromosomes and is pulled apart by mitotic spindle
      1. **Prophase:** chromatin condenses into chromosomes
      2. **Prometaphase:** Nuclear envelope dissolves, mitotic spindle begins to form
      3. **Metaphase:** Mitotic spindle completely formed, chromosomes lined up at middle of cell (metaphase plate)
      4. **Anaphase:** Microtubules shorten, pulling chromosomes to opposite ends of cell *(daughter chromosomes)*; cell elongates
      5. **Telophase:** Two nuclei are formed
   2. **Cytokinesis:** Cytoplasm of cell is split in two, making two new cells
   
### 3. What types of cells undergo mitosis and for what purpose?

Somatic cells, adult stem cells, embryo cells; this is to grow and replace worn out cells, or, in the case of embryo cells, to form a new organism entirely.

### 4. Draw out the stages of mitosis
