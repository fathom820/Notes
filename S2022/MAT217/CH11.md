# Chapter 11: Randomization Hypothesis Tests

## Hypothesis Tests

*Are individuals who identify as female discriminated against inpromotion decisions by managers?*
- The data shown from 1972 suggests there couul a slight correlation, assuming equal amounts of men and women (at first glance)
- Could solve this question with conditional probability
- Null hypothesis: believe there is no association between sex and promotion
    - H<sub>0</sub>: The two variables are independent
    - H<sub>A</sub>: The two variables are dependent

What would it mean (in terms of the problem) if the two variables are independent?
- Decision for promotion doesn't matter if you're male or female

**Assume null hypothesis is true unless you can prove it *not likely***

- Given you're male, what's probability you're promoted?
- Given you're female, what's probability you're promoted?

If we do the process shown on the slides, we get a randomization distribution. **(see ppt)**

- P-value: 2/100

**Reject independence, favor dependence.**

*How to do in minitab: **calc** -> **resampling** -> **bootstrapping***

### Theory on this will be on the final

### Pearson's Distance

How do we choose which point on the model to choose? (how to pick *E*<sub>1</sub>)

Independence: `P(A & B) = P(A) P(B)`

So we'll use that formula in conjunction with the table we actually observed to get our expected counts

Expected Cell Counts: **see slides, he went too fast**

### Hypothesis Test

Hypothesis:
- H<sub>0</sub>: The two variables are independent
- H<sub>a</sub>: The two variables are dependent/associated

Significance level: *a* (problem specific)

Assumptions
1. Both vars are categorical
2. Data randomly taken
3. All expected cell counts are at least 5 (theoretical reasons)

Test statistic: **see slides, he went too fast**

P-value: this is always a right-tailed test!
`P(T > t)` where *T* ~= x<sup>2</sup><sub>(r-1)(c-1)</sub>
