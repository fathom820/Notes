# Notes
I prefer to hand-write my notes in my college classes, then transform them into digital versions that are actually legible. All of these files are in Markdown (.md) format.

Information should be free, so I'm leaving my notes here for any future students in Shippensburg University's CS program that might find them helpful.

Cheers
